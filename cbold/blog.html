<p>Buffalo Wild Wings sponsored us previously with a few fundraising events and some money. They also requested a team dinner which was great. We liked working with them.</p>

<p>SECO was one of our favorite sponsors. They gave us a tour and a pizza party and we showed them our robot. It was a nice experience and look forward to working with them again.</p>
